# ICLR 2026 OpenReview Desk Rejection – Public Review Log Archive

## Purpose

This repository provides a **structured, verifiable archive** of publicly accessible
OpenReview records related to an ICLR 2026 submission that received a desk rejection.

The purpose of this repository is **not** to accuse, speculate, or assign intent.

Instead, it aims to:
- Preserve publicly visible OpenReview materials in a stable format
- Organize review, rebuttal, and metadata logs for third-party inspection
- Enable independent readers to verify procedural timelines and records directly

All materials are derived exclusively from **public OpenReview pages**.

---

## Scope and Principles

**Included**
- Desk rejection notice
- Reviewer comments and scores
- Author rebuttal text
- Publicly visible reviewer confidence values
- Time-stamped screenshots for verifiability
- The originally submitted paper (unaltered)

**Excluded**
- Private communications
- Identity inference beyond OpenReview pseudonyms
- Claims of misconduct, bias, or intent
- Interpretive or evaluative language

**Operating principles**
- Descriptive, not accusatory
- Primary sources over commentary
- No claims beyond what is directly observable

## Data Source

Primary source:
- OpenReview (ICLR 2026 submission forum)

The original OpenReview page remains the authoritative source.
This repository exists to **preserve accessibility and readability**.

---

## Capture Method

- Screenshots were captured using **GoFullPage**
- Dates are encoded in filenames
- No visual modifications were applied
- URL-context screenshots are included where relevant to ensure traceability

---

## Notes on Interpretation

- “No response observed” is used only when no public reply exists after a rebuttal
- Score or confidence values are recorded exactly as displayed
- Absence of activity is treated as an observable state, not an inference

Readers are encouraged to:
1. Inspect the archived materials
2. Compare with the original OpenReview page
3. Draw independent conclusions
